impliment the interpreter as a class so you can have multiple
have 2 dictionaries, a 'global' dictionary and a 'local' dictionary.

switch to smart pointers for clean defining/undefining words

replace array of char * in a word struct with pointer to other words for traditional forth-like words and word chaining
allow words to enumerate other types like
string literals
ints and floats
arrays
flow control statements
